### Hi there 👋
- I'm Mathis Gheno, MSc. student in Rennes university
- 📖 I study ecolological modeling and statistics
- 🧐 I'm interested in species interactions in ecosytems, on how they can shape or impact the world around us and how computationnal methods can help us to understand it better.
- 📈 I'm also interested by machin learning methods
- 🔍 I've mainly worked on:
- 🦊 developing tools to disentangled species interactions from abundance data
- 🌱 linking functional plants traits with interactions
- 🦠 uncover potential viral emergence from host virus network
